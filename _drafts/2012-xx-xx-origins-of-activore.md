title: How I Became An Activore
---

 - big goals of helping the world with no way to get there
 - activore as a means... and an end?

I cannot claim a scrap of credit for the initial idea of Activore— yet here i am, and have been from the start, helping bring it into the world.

Like so many things, it's all in who you know— in this case, two of my co-founders.

The most important thing i did for Activore was bring Wes and Brian together.

Wesley Adam Shaffer, characteristically, came into my life doing a favor for a friend.  He had his people help organize travel to a concert for classical pianist <a href="http://elena-ulyanova.com/">Elena Ulyanova</a> and found a place to stay, my house, on <a href="http://couchsurfing.org/">CouchSurfing.org</a>.  As co-founder of Life Long Solutions, a fitness equipment supply and distribution company that owns a gym of its own, Wes made the trip from Pennsylvania to Massachusetts pay for itself by delivering equipment in the area.

Brian Dominick and i met when i found <a href="http:// i helped support the , starting an occasional correspondence and meeting at media reform conferences. came to <a href="http://agaric.com/">Agaric</a>, a web development shop i cofounded in 2006, in the beginning of January 2012 and led us on our best year for revenues, ever.  Brian joined Agaric, which is organized as a collective of equal worker-owners (or, simply, principals), in part because of his interest in egalitarian organizatonal structure.

This does tie into Activore.

I have always wanted to help people gain the most power possible over our own lives.  I also never come up with for-profit ways to do that.  Indeed, even the typical top-heavy well-staffed not-for-profit, the kind that you're most likely to hear about and be asked to donate to, is inimical to the volantary association of people i think we need to become to change the world.

On our first meeting, Wesley shared with me a very similar vision for an organization that is about connecting people and helping make great and shared ideas become reality.  Brian shares the broader goal of people having more control of our lives, and the equalization of power this necessitates, but is skeptical of the "visions unite" organization approach.

We all knew, however, that a self-coordinated movement of millions is harder to start than a business that helps people.

Agaric worked with, and discussed working with, many organizations, businesses, and startups.  In 2011, with the influnce of then-principal <a href="http://misscs.com/">Claudina Sarahe</a>, we concluded that moving away from only providing services toward developing our own product , or even starting a new company is the way to bigger and better things

The first idea Wesley pitched us was an app to connect people who would make good workout partners.  We found that there are many who have tried to do something like this.  The best current effort is probably from our colleagues at <a href="http://tivity.us/">Tivity</a>.
