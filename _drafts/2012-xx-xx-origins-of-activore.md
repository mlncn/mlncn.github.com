title: How I Became An Activore
---

 - big goals of helping the world with no way to get there
 - activore as a means... and an end?

I cannot claim a scrap of credit for the initial idea of Activore— yet here i am, and have been from the start, helping bring it into the world.

Like so many things, it's all in who you know— in this case, two of my co-founders.

The most important thing i did for Activore was bring Wes and Brian together.

Characteristically, Wesley Adam Shaffer came into my life doing a favor for a friend.  As co-founder of Life Long Solutions, a fitness equipment supply and distribution company, he had met classical pianist <a href="http://elena-ulyanova.com/">Elena Ulyanova</a>. A musician himself, Wes helped organize travel to a concert for Elena, and an employee of his found a place to stay, my house, on <a href="http://couchsurfing.org/">CouchSurfing.org</a>.  Wes made the trip from Pennsylvania to Massachusetts pay for itself by delivering equipment in the area.

My first contact with Brian Dominick came making a donation to a fantastic, assiduously fact-checked daily online newspaper which he had co-founded.  <a href="http://newstandardnews.net">The NewStandard</a> covered news from the standpoint of impact on people's lives and how people can act collectively to affect these events.  In addition to founding the non-profit newspaper, Brian had developed and maintained its web site and helped develop its non-hierarchical, journalist-managed structure.  Five years after the NewStandard ceased publication due to its principled refusal to accept funding from any source accept its readers (combined with a failure of self-avowed progressive news aggregators to promote its articles), Brian joined Stefan Freudenberg and myself at <a href="http://agaric.com/">Agaric</a>, a web development shop i cofounded in 2006.  Organized as a collective of equal worker-owners (or, simply, principals), Agaric interested Brian in part for the chance to develop a more effective egalitarian organizatonal structure.  Starting in the beginning of 2012, Brian led Agaric to our best year for revenues, ever.

This does tie into Activore, but first my story will take us farther afield.

I have always wanted to help all people gain the most power possible over our own lives.  That, to me, is a definition of justice and liberty grounded in human fact, which even hints at the derived principles of equality and prosperity.  I also never come up with for-profit ways to do that.  Indeed, even the typical large not-for-profits, the kind that you're most likely to hear about and be asked to donate to, have  top-down approaches inimical to the voluntary associations of people i think we need to become to change the world.

On our first meeting, Wesley shared with me his vision for a network that is about connecting people and helping make great shared ideas become reality.  Wesley's goal to develop this network closely aligned with mine.  We both knew, however, that a self-coordinated movement of millions is harder to start than a business that helps people.  Wesley almost immediatly began to talk about what sort of business we could do together to gain the skills, resources, and connections that would help us make this avowedly not-for-profit network possible.

Meanwhile, Agaric had long worked with, and discussed working with, many organizations, businesses, and startups.  In 2011, with the influnce of then-principal <a href="http://misscs.com/">Claudina Sarahe</a>, we had concluded that moving away from only providing services and toward developing our own product, even if that meant launching a separate company, is the path to more ambitious, more interesting, and more rewarding work.  Brian and i met with Wesley to share his ideas.

The first idea Wesley suggested was an app to connect people who would make good workout partners.  We found that there are many who have tried to do something like this.  A current effort we like is from our colleagues at <a href="http://tivity.us/">Tivity</a>, but all seem to have trouble reaching critical mass.  As a gym owner himself, Wesley always conceived of this "workout buddy" feature as being based in the existing community of gym members.

Pretty quickly as we talked about it, Wesley's original idea began to evolve and expand to where, months and many, many proposed names later, it became the inspirational and aspirational online augmenter of venue and program-based fitness communities that Activore strives to be today.
